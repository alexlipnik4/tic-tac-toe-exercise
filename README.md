# Home Exercise
This is a frontend exercise using React.js to build a functioning [Tic Tac Toe game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) that should work the following way:

## Objective
- The first player to go places an **X** anywhere on the board, 
and then the next player will be able to place an **O**, 
and it continues alternating like this every turn. 
- You should also implement a function to determine if any player won by getting 3 **X**'s or **O**'s in a row. 
- If there is a winner, display a message at the top. If nobody wins, display "Draw". 
- Finally, you should also implement the reset function that resets the entire board.

_Ideally, this should take around a few hours finish, but let us know how much time you spent so we can calibrate our expectations!_

## Hints / Tips
- You can feel free to use something like `Redux` or `mobX` to store the board, but the exact implementation is up to you!
- It doesn't have to look pixel perfect with amazing animations, but we do care a lot about UX and usability.
  - Ideally your components would fit and would be aligned, to make layout easy for your users.
  - You can (if you want) pick any UI toolkit (Bootstrap, Material, etc.), but try to make everything look consistent.
- You can see an example example of Tic Tac Toe over [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=tic+tac+toe).

## Getting Started
- Clone or download the repository - do not fork!
- Run `npm install` & `npm start` Your browser should open up a skeleton React app. You can edit any file in `./src` and in most cases the website will hot-reload.
- We provided some simple React template code, but feel free to modify it.
- You can use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons of **O** & **X**.
- When ready submit your result in one of the following methods:
  - Create a new repository under your own account and send us link
  - Email us a zip file with the source code

## Requirements
- The code must compile with no errors.
- There should be no errors in the browser console.
- It should work smoothly with Google Chrome.

## Bonus
- Make the **O** a computer player.
